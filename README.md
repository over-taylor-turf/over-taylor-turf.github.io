## Project Description ✅

My goal with this project is to highlight (improve and practice) my mobile-first design first and foremost. I want to put together a portfolio website that showcases some really good responsive design practices. I also want to keep it as clean as possible. I am using Matt Farley's website as inspiration for my "cleanliness" in design. I am currently intimidated by JavaScript so I also want to take this project as an opportunity to get more confident and comfortable. I Would like to do some intense work around animations for the welcome (home) section, my projects and skills if I have time. I would like it to be very interactive in the sense that as the user hovers, clicks, explores, the website responds.

## Case 1: Hamburger Dropdown Menu

For the hamburger dropdown menu, I followed W3Schools suggestions:
[Link](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp)

And, I also found this StackOverflow article helpful: 
[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291942/what-does-javascriptvoid0-mean)

I also learned after some research online that the jQuery .toggle() function is actually toggling between the ```display: none``` and ```display: block```. 
```css
.topnav #myLinks {
  display: none;
}
```
Because of this, I decided to use the function: 
```js
$('.icon').on('click', function(event){
  event.preventDefault();
  $('.topnav #myLinks').toggle();
});
```

instead of W3Schools suggestion on their 'Mobile NavBar' page.
```js
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myLinks");
  if (x.style.display === "block") {
    x.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "block";
  }
}
```

I tried to experiment with the hamburger navigation as a ```<button>``` instead of a ```<a>```, but I found that the styling because much worse due to the default styling of buttons, so I abandoned this plan! 

```
<a href="#" class="icon"><i class="fa fa-bars"></i></a>
```

## Case 2: Button, MailTo 

I deeply struggled with creating a contact form that would populate a Google Sheet with submitted info.
This project was scrapped and instead I used a button to open a new, blank email message. 
Several sites helped me: 
Stack Overflow: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21461589/javascript-mailto-using-window-open)
CSS Tricks: [Link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/)

## Case 3: Button, MailTo 

I spent a lot of time researching how to implement a carousel or slideshow for my testimonials section. 

I also attempted to just have a .fadeIn / .fadeOut function, but could not make it work alongside an .active / .inactive class. 

The resources that helped me with my testimonials slideshow are: 

CSSTricks Article: [Link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/simple-auto-playing-slideshow/)
Chris Coyier Code Pen: [Link](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/zKbYzP)
This StackOverflow article about centering a position:absolute element: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8508275/how-to-center-a-position-absolute-element)

I would like to note that this is the original CSS from Chris Coyier: 
```css

#slideshow {
  margin: 80px auto;
  position: relative;
  width: 240px;
  height: 240px;
  padding: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

#slideshow > div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
  right: 10px;
  bottom: 10px;
}

```

But I heavily edited it to be: 
```css
        #slideshow {
            margin: 0 auto;
            position: relative;
            font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
            font-weight: 400;
          }
          
          #slideshow > div {
            position: absolute;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            left: 0;
            right: 0;
            text-align: center;
            background-color: #f7b352;
            padding-top: 150px;
            padding-bottom: 100px;
            padding: 100px 50px 100px 50px;
          }

          .quotes {
              text-align: center;
              color: #0A3CC8; 
              font-size: 2em;
              line-height: 130%;
          }

          .attributes {
              float: right;
              color: #B63666; 
              font-size: 1.4em;
          }

          .fa-quote-left {
              float: left;
          }

          .fa-quote-right {
            float: right;
        }

        .helpme {
            padding-top: 500px;
            background-color: #f7b352;
        }

        .testimonials-title {
            text-align: center;
            justify-self: center;
            font-family: 'Bebas Neue', cursive;
            font-size: 3.5em;
            color: #B63666; 
            padding: 65px 0;
            background-color: #f7b352; 
        }


```
One strategy I learned is to mute every line of code I don't understand and then add them back to see what their actual effect is. 
If there are lines that I still do not understand, I leave them muted and try to write my own code. 
I also had to add a lot of extra things to this slideshow in order to get my text to display as desired. 

As for the JavaScript... 
```js

      $("#slideshow > div:gt(0)").hide();

            setInterval(function() {
              $('#slideshow > div:first')
                .fadeOut(1000)
                .next()
                .fadeIn(1000)
                .end()
                .appendTo('#slideshow');
            }, 3000);

```

I learned a lot from this. I did not know that the > symbol selects the children when used in the CSS selector. 
I also had to research what `:gt()` was, and I learned from W3 schools that it just basically saying +1 to the index of an item.
