## Project Description ✅

My goal with this project is to highlight (improve and practice) my mobile-first design first and foremost. I want to put together a portfolio website that showcases some really good responsive design practices. I also want to keep it as clean as possible. I am using Matt Farley's website as inspiration for my "cleanliness" in design. I am currently intimidated by JavaScript so I also want to take this project as an opportunity to get more confident and comfortable. I Would like to do some intense work around animations for the welcome (home) section, my projects and skills if I have time. I would like it to be very interactive in the sense that as the user hovers, clicks, explores, the website responds.

## Case 1: Hamburger Dropdown Menu

For the hamburger dropdown menu, I followed W3Schools suggestions:
[Link](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp)

And, I also found this StackOverflow article helpful: 
[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291942/what-does-javascriptvoid0-mean)

I also learned after some research online that the jQuery .toggle() function is actually toggling between the ```display: none``` and ```display: block```. 
```
.topnav #myLinks {
  display: none;
}
```
Because of this, I decided to use the function: 
```
$('.icon').on('click', function(event){
  event.preventDefault();
  $('.topnav #myLinks').toggle();
});
```

instead of W3Schools suggestion on their 'Mobile NavBar' page.
```
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myLinks");
  if (x.style.display === "block") {
    x.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "block";
  }
}
```

I tried to experiment with the hamburger navigation as a ```<button>``` instead of a ```<a>```, but I found that the styling because much worse due to the default styling of buttons, so I abandoned this plan! 

```
<a href="#" class="icon"><i class="fa fa-bars"></i></a>
```
