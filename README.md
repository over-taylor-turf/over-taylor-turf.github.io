# Portfolio
🎉 Welcome to my first, ever website as a developer! 🎉
🚨 This website has been kept largely untouched, besides updating some links and photos in the 'projects' section. There are many, many improvements that could be made, in theory, to this vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML masterpiece 😂 but I am leaving it as a reminder of how far I've come as a developer.

## Project Description ✅

My goal with this project is to highlight (improve and practice) my mobile-first design first and foremost. I want to put together a portfolio website that showcases some really good responsive design practices. I also want to keep it as clean as possible. I am using Matt Farley's website as inspiration for my "cleanliness" in design. I am currently intimidated by JavaScript so I also want to take this project as an opportunity to get more confident and comfortable. I Would like to do some intense work around animations for the welcome (home) section, my projects and skills if I have time. I would like it to be very interactive in the sense that as the user hovers, clicks, explores, the website responds.

## Additional Libraries ✅

I definitely want to learn about and get practice in Bootstrap for this project. ❌ (Update: I created a very intense CSS Grid before learning about the specifics of Bootstrap and felt I could not make Bootstrap work without deleting a lot of my hard work. I also wanted to get more practice doing a lot of the coding by myself instead of copying and pasting what Bootstrap has to offer. In the future, I will definitely use it, but not for this project!)

I also want to use FontAwesome for my icons. ✅ (Update: FontAweseom proved very helpful and I learned a lot about the `<i>` tag!)

## Code Snippets ✅

Here are some code snippets that I feel proud of! 🤗

I am proud of my organization here in my HMTL of the icons, text, and attributed name. I originally just created these "testimonials" as [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DgE7cblrkF_aLyCffqiZKk0jjIsy4x5fcTHWuS4p6l4/edit?usp=sharing) and took a screen shot to make them into images to display in my slideshow. Then, I remembered that I am a developer and I can make it myself! Additionally, you will notice the final line, `<div class="helpme"></div>`, the purpose of this div is to solve a specific issue: the slide show has a `position: absolute` in the CSS which causes it to overlap onto the contact section. I solved this problem by creating this "helpme" `<div>` to provide a background and spacing. 
```html

<div id="testimonials" class="testimonials-title"><h3>Testimonials</h3></div>
<div id="slideshow">
    <div class="testimonials">
        <i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i><br>
        <p class="quotes">Fake quote about how amazing Taylor is.</p><br>
        <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i><br><br><br>
        <p class="attributes">—Fake Person Name</p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonials">
        <i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i><br>
        <p class="quotes">“More words explaining why Taylor should get hired by you.”</p><br>
        <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i><br><br><br>
        <p class="attributes">—Fakey McFakerson</p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonials">
        <i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i><br>
        <p class="quotes">“Truly amazing!”</p><br>
        <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i><br><br><br>
        <p class="attributes">—A Fake Coworker’s Name </p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonials">
        <i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i><br>
        <p class="quotes">“More words explaining why Taylor should get hired by you.”</p><br>
        <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i><br><br><br>
        <p class="attributes">—Fake Fakeburg</p>
    </div>
</div>

      <div class="helpme"></div>

```

Of my three children (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), CSS is my favorite (don't tell the others). As such, there are many lines of my CSS code that I am proud of. I spent the most time in my CSS file. For example, I am proud of the different Grid layouts I created for each section of my webpage. I am proud of the `:hover` effects I created for many of my sections as well. Most of all, I am proud of one very key decision I made early on in regards to designing my webpage. I spent a long time thinking about a color scheme, looked at some online palette generators, but ultimately build the color scheme from the ground up with the [image](http://res.cloudinary.com/overturf/image/upload/v1633966172/IMG-3349_bue4kq.jpg) I chose of myself. I used the color picker extension on my browser to extract specific hexcodes from this single image: the royal blue background, the hot pink on my glasses, some creams and yellows literally from my hair. This provided the color palette for my entire site and I kept these hexcodes at the top of my CSS to easily draw upon! 

```css

/* COLORS -- here are where my specific hex-codes go for this project. 

ROYAL BLUE: #0A3CC8

DARKER PINK: #9c0248
BRIGHTER PINK: #B63666
LIGHTER PINK: #e86892
LIGHTEST PINK: #ffcfde

GOLD: #d18519
EGG YOLK: #f7b352
OFF WHITE: #fff6e3
SAND: #F2E2C6

*/

```

I am so proud of this  very simple animation. I wrote this function completely independently and it did not work for the longest time. Little did I know it was because I just needed another script link to a UI jQuery library. My function was completely functional the whole time! 
```js

  $('.welcome').on('click', function(event){
    $('.welcome').effect( 'bounce', {times: 5}, 'slow' );
  });

```

## Issues and Resolutions ❌
 
 Many of my issues and resolutions were captured by the issue tickets I opened while working on my portfolio. 
 
 #### Case 1: Dropdown Menu Functionality
**Issue**: Hamburger drop down will only toggle upon clicking the icon, and not the links as well. In other words, I wanted the dropdown menu to disappear not only upon clicking the hamburger again, but also upon making a navigational selection.

```js

$('.icon').on('click', function(event){
  event.preventDefault();
  $('#myLinks').toggle();
});

```                     
**Resolution**: I added a second function to also add the toggle function to the links in the dropdown (called `#myLinks`) as well as the hamburger icon (called `.icon`). I also deleted the `event.preventDefault();` line of code because it was preventing my dropdown menu functionality as well! 
```js

$('.icon').on('click', function(event){
  $('#myLinks').toggle();
});

$('#myLinks').on('click', function(event){
  $('#myLinks').toggle();
});

```

#### Case 2: CSS Grid of Projects Section
**Issue**: I had one specific section of my site that was not responding responsively from mobile to desktop view: the "Projects" section. I would like the three projects to be stacked vertically in mobile view, and sit horizontally in a row in desktop view.

**Resolution**:
Here is my original CSS code block for the tablet/desktop responsive view: 
```css

/* PROJECTS SECTION */
#projects {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}      

        .project1, .project2, .project3 {
            font-weight: 400;
        }

        .project-title {
            font-size: 60px;
            grid-template-columns: 1 / 4;
            grid-template-rows: 1 / 2;
        }

        .project1 {
            grid-template-columns: 1 / 2;
            grid-template-rows: 2 / 5;
        }

        .project2 {
            grid-template-columns: 2 / 3;
            grid-template-rows: 2 / 5;
        }

        .project3 {
            grid-template-columns: 3 / 4;
            grid-template-rows: 2 / 5;
        }

```
Notice anything? 

My error was very simple. Instead of writing `grid-column: # / #` and `grid-row: # / #`, I was actually redefining the grid each time! With repeated `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`! 🤦🏼‍♀️

#### Case 3: Favicon Display
**Issue**: I had some trouble with my favicon displaying in chrome. At first, I thought it had to with where I was placing the tags within the `<head>`, but then Jason alerted me to the fact that it was viewable in Safari, just not Chrome.

**Resolution**:
This [StackOverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16375592/favicon-not-showing-up-in-google-chrome) was very helpful. As I learned that other people have had issues with Chrome displaying their favicons. I cleared my cache as one commenter suggested and it worked! 


## Citations of Outside Sources / Help 🙌

## Case 1: Hamburger Dropdown Menu

For the hamburger dropdown menu, I followed W3Schools suggestions:
[Link](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp)

And, I also found this StackOverflow article helpful: 
[Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291942/what-does-javascriptvoid0-mean)

I  learned after some research online that the jQuery .toggle() function is actually toggling between the ```display: none``` and ```display: block```. This was revolutionary for my understanding of how to build my function. 

```css

.topnav #myLinks {
  display: none;
}

```

Because of this, I decided to use the function: 
```js

$('.icon').on('click', function(event){
  event.preventDefault();
  $('.topnav #myLinks').toggle();
});

```

instead of W3Schools suggestion on their 'Mobile NavBar' page.
```js

function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myLinks");
  if (x.style.display === "block") {
    x.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "block";
  }
}

```

I tried to experiment with the hamburger navigation as a ```<button>``` instead of a ```<a>```, but I found that the styling because much worse due to the default styling of buttons, so I abandoned this plan! 

```html

<a href="#" class="icon"><i class="fa fa-bars"></i></a>

```

## Case 2: Button, MailTo 

I deeply struggled with creating a contact form that would populate a Google Sheet with submitted info. This project was scrapped and instead I used a button to open a new, blank email message. 

Several sites helped me: 
Stack Overflow: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21461589/javascript-mailto-using-window-open)
CSS Tricks: [Link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/)
Plunker: [Link](https://embed.plnkr.co/plunk/J0LvQU)

I found this route to align more with my current understandings, so I felt much more comfortable.

## Case 3: Slideshow

I spent a lot of time researching how to implement a carousel or slideshow for my testimonials section. 

I also attempted to just have a .fadeIn / .fadeOut function, but could not make it work alongside an .active / .inactive class. 

The resources that helped me with my testimonials slideshow are: 

CSSTricks Article: [Link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/simple-auto-playing-slideshow/)
Chris Coyier Code Pen: [Link](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/zKbYzP)
This StackOverflow article about centering a position:absolute element: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8508275/how-to-center-a-position-absolute-element)

I would like to note that this is the original CSS from Chris Coyier: 
```css

#slideshow {
  margin: 80px auto;
  position: relative;
  width: 240px;
  height: 240px;
  padding: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

#slideshow > div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
  right: 10px;
  bottom: 10px;
}

```

But I heavily edited it to be: 
```css
        #slideshow {
            margin: 0 auto;
            position: relative;
            font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
            font-weight: 400;
          }
          
          #slideshow > div {
            position: absolute;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            left: 0;
            right: 0;
            text-align: center;
            background-color: #f7b352;
            padding-top: 150px;
            padding-bottom: 100px;
            padding: 100px 50px 100px 50px;
          }

          .quotes {
              text-align: center;
              color: #0A3CC8; 
              font-size: 2em;
              line-height: 130%;
          }

          .attributes {
              float: right;
              color: #B63666; 
              font-size: 1.4em;
          }

          .fa-quote-left {
              float: left;
          }

          .fa-quote-right {
            float: right;
        }

        .helpme {
            padding-top: 500px;
            background-color: #f7b352;
        }

        .testimonials-title {
            text-align: center;
            justify-self: center;
            font-family: 'Bebas Neue', cursive;
            font-size: 3.5em;
            color: #B63666; 
            padding: 65px 0;
            background-color: #f7b352; 
        }


```
One strategy I learned is to mute every line of code I don't understand and then add them back to see what their actual effect is. 
If there are lines that I still do not understand, I leave them muted and try to write my own code. 
I also had to add a lot of extra things to this slideshow in order to get my text to display as desired. 

As for the JavaScript... 
```js

      $("#slideshow > div:gt(0)").hide();

            setInterval(function() {
              $('#slideshow > div:first')
                .fadeOut(1000)
                .next()
                .fadeIn(1000)
                .end()
                .appendTo('#slideshow');
            }, 3000);

```

I learned a lot from this. I did not know that the > symbol selects the children when used in the CSS selector.

I also had to research what `:gt()` was, and I learned from W3 schools that it just basically saying +1 to the index of an item.
